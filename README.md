# AWS--From-Scratch
These are my AWS Learnings 

AWS 
AWS stands for Amazon Web Services. It's a comprehensive and evolving cloud computing platform offered by Amazon. AWS provides a wide range of services, including computing power, storage, databases, machine learning, analytics, and more, all accessible via the internet on a pay-as-you-go basis. It's widely used by businesses of all sizes to build and host their applications, store and analyze data, and innovate rapidly without the need to invest in and manage physical infrastructure.

Example:
AWS is like a vast digital city where companies can rent space to build their online homes. It provides all the infrastructure needed to run websites, apps, and services, from storage and computing power to databases and AI tools. So, instead of setting up their own servers and data centers, businesses can simply lease what they need from AWS, saving time, money, and headaches.
